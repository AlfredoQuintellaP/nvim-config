# My Neovim Config

It all began because I thought it looked cool, but then I started to realize that Vim motions — and the understanding that Vim/Neovim gave me — were actually really helpful.
In the beginning, I used LazyVim and later tried LunarVim for a while, but there were too many features I didn’t even understand, so I decided to create my own configuration.

## Plugins

All plugins are managed by [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).  
Each plugin has its own config file inside `lua/plugins/`.

### Main Plugins

→ Colorscheme that looked cool.
